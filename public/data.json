The proposed project involves the design, engineering, and construction of a DWP and approximately 56.18 statute miles of pipeline infrastructure. The 12-acre Harbor Island Facility, located on Harbor Island in Nueces County, would consist of pig launchers/receivers, meters and valves, operations building, and communications facility, with no crude oil storage on site.<br /> The Bluewater DWP would allow for the loading of two (2) very large crude carriers (VLCCs) at the proposed DWP via two single point mooring (SPM) buoy systems and connect with the DWP via floating connecting crude oil hoses.  The proposed Project would be capable of loading rates of up to approximately 80,000 barrels per hour (bph).  The proposed Project is expected to service 16 VLCCs per month."
