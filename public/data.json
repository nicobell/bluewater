The proposed project involves the design, engineering, and construction of a DWP and approximately 56.18 statute miles of pipeline infrastructure. The 12-acre Harbor Island Facility, located on Harbor Island in Nueces County, would consist of pig launchers/receivers, meters and valves, operations building, and communications facility, with no crude oil storage on site.<br /> The Bluewater DWP would allow for the loading of two (2) very large crude carriers (VLCCs) at the proposed DWP via two single point mooring (SPM) buoy systems and connect with the DWP via floating connecting crude oil hoses.  The proposed Project would be capable of loading rates of up to approximately 80,000 barrels per hour (bph).  The proposed Project is expected to service 16 VLCCs per month."

The proposed project involves the design, engineering, and construction of a deepwater port, approximately 56.18 statute miles of pipeline infrastructure. The Bluewater deepwater port would allow for up to two (2) very large crude carriers (VLCCs) or other crude oil carriers to moor at single point mooring (SPM) buoys and connect with the deepwater port via floating connecting crude oil hoses. During single vessel loading operations, the proposed project is capable of loading rates of up to approximately 80,000 barrels per hour (bph) and during simultaneous vessel loading operations, the proposed project is capable of loading rates of 40,000 bph. The facility is expected to service 16 VLCCs per month.Bluewater is proposing to construct, own, operate, and the eventual decommission a deepwater port terminal in the Gulf of Mexico to export domestically produced crude oil.
