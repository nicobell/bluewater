The proposed project involves the design, engineering, and construction of a DWP and approximately 56.18 statute miles of pipeline infrastructure. The 12-acre Harbor Island Facility, located on Harbor Island in Nueces County, would consist of pig launchers/receivers, meters and valves, operations building, and communications facility, with no crude oil storage on site.<br /> The Bluewater DWP would allow for the loading of two (2) very large crude carriers (VLCCs) at the proposed DWP via two single point mooring (SPM) buoy systems and connect with the DWP via floating connecting crude oil hoses.  The proposed Project would be capable of loading rates of up to approximately 80,000 barrels per hour (bph).  The proposed Project is expected to service 16 VLCCs per month."

                - To inform the public and encourage and facilitate public involvement in federal agency activities that may affect the quality of the human environment.<br />
                Guidelines for Federal agencies to implement NEPA were established in regulations by the President’s Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in 40 CFR 1500-1508. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard) has issued implementing procedures and policy for considering environmental impacts under NEPA and related laws.<br />
                Documents prepared under NEPA include a Categorical Exclusion, and Environmental Assessment, and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). When a proposed action has the potential for significant impacts, and EIS, the most detailed analysis conducted under NEPA, is prepared.",
